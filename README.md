# Grant Search (MVP)
This tool is the result of stakeholder and client research to find better ways for non-profits to connect to grant opportunities and each other.  This excercise is a student product from Cohort 2 students at [Moms Can Code School](a href="https://www.momscan.co/).  It does not contain backend tools at the moment and is used for testing and demo purposes only.
